This week, I have implemented gaussian elimination for the inversion of matrices.
Since I have finished my part, I have nothing left to do for the moment. We will have a meeting to discuss that next week,
However after speaking with the leaders, it came that I might either work either on polynomial solutions, 
the Horrowitz-Ostrogradzky algorithm or the help another team.
