This week I worked on updating the main branch of the project by merging  (fixing bugs, errors, making code more compact) the files of different teams, so everybody can download up 
to date working project from git. After this have been working on improving the image preprocessing part. I wrote the new/clearer and precise function for numerically  
solving the integral of the function. With Marie I have fixed Tokenizer file which is now working. With Lucien we I was working on fining the model which can be used for  
prediction in Machine learning. 

Next week, implementing prediction for Image Recognition and try to wrap everything together (at least the basics)
