This week I again spent a lot of time managing Git, adding instructions on how to build the project. With Lazar we also
finished up on image preprocessing and wrote some code for character segmentation. I also wrote some basic utility functions 
which will be required for our network and began working on our forward pass, although there is still progress to be made in
this area which will be the focus of next week's coding.
