This week, I continued working on the outer structure of the Derivatives project and specifically the .solve() function that solves derivatives. I switched many functions to template functions as this was causing an issue last week, and I included more pointers for certain functions. My code now compiles correctly. Next week I plan on starting to work on the step-by-step part of the derivative solver. I have not been able to debug the .solve() function yet because the AbstractFunction constructor and its own print function needs to be finalized first. In the case that they are, I will also debug the .solve() function to ensure that it works correctly. There is still one aspect I have yet to figure out, which is how we will represent 'e' and 'ln' in the exponential and logarithmic functions, respectively. 

I would also like to point out that there was a GitHub issue between Merlin and I this week. We are working on the same two files (derivatives.hpp and derivatives.cpp). He was having trouble accessing my code, so I sent it to him via email. I added the changes I made to my code on Thursday, and later that day Merlin also added his changes, but since he had copy pasted my code, it says he made those changes, which is not the case. You can still see the changes I made from my commit, so I hope this won't be an issue.
