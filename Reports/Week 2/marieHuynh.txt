This week I continued working on the class token and the function simplify. I came up with a first version that still needs work. I encountered several problems : the differentiation between char and string in some functions, and also since I defined the token class with a template T, I had some problems defining a vector of tokens (since they can be from different classes (operators, variable, functions, ...). This week I intend to fix these bugs and do a better version. If I am done with this, I may start to work on the main structure of our step by step derivative (with templates functions), on which Constance is currently working.
