For week three, as a group we had to do a total restructuring of the code around a token class and vectors instead of strings
written by Marie. All the necessary code hasnt been fully uploaded so I rewrote a new version of the constructor following
the new setup but I cannot upload it yet. Secondly I wrote a form new file to test the structure of our trees and for the 
same reason, it lacks specific keywords to be uploaded and thus I will upload both next week.
