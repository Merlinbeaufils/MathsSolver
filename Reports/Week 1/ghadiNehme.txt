This week, we determined which functions we are going to implement:
A function that takes a function and  returns all its roots
A function that takes a function and an interval and returns the value of the integral of the function on the interval
A function that takes a function and a value and returns the value of its derivative at this point
A function that takes a system of differential equations and returns a solution

This week, we implemented the function that returns the derivative of a function at a point, and we searched for ways to implement the function that returns the roots of a function.
