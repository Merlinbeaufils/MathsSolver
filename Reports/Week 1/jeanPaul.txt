This week we all have discuss the structure of the derivate program,in order to facilitate the work , and divide the main areas.
I have been working in collaboration with constance ferragu in the implementation of the sub-classes ,especially in the implementations of the basic solve methods for the different sub-classes.
For the moment the program have not been able to compile hence we have not prove if it works, but this will be solved hopefully in the next week.
Next week i will be working in the implementation of the printing of the solution of the programm ,specifically the transformation of an AbstractFunction object into a string.
If possible this will be used to create a step by step solution
